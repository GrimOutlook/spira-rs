# spira-rs
SpiraTest API bindings for Rust ðŸ¦€

This is a fork of [spira by alxolr](https://github.com/alxolr/spira).
At the time I forked this repo, it hadn't been touched in 2 years and was missing almost all of features that I needed but their code is the basis for this codebase.

Bindings are currently tested for SpiraTest v5.4.0.4 which is the version I use at work.
I developed these in my free time, so I could let other people use them.
I want to eventually support present day SpiraTest but that is a less pressing matter as we currently don't utilize it.

Contributions are welcome ðŸ™‚

## Usage

```rust
use spira::SpiraClient;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let api_key = env::var("SPIRA_API_KEY")?;
    let username = env::var("SPIRA_USERNAME")?;
    let base_url = env::var("SPIRA_API_URL")?;

    let spira_client = SpiraClient::new(&base_url, &api_key, &username)?;
    let projects = spira_client.projects().await?;

    println!("{:#?}", projects);
    Ok(())
}
```
